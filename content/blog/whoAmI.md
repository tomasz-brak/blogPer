## Hi

My name is Tomasz. I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. When I finished my fifth grade in primary school, I went to an event and wrote code for robots made of Lego. I've fallen in love with programming ever since.

## My journey

When I first started programming, I used simple tools. The first was the visual editor for Lego. And then I familiarized myself with scratch. I've created way too many 2D games with that one. Then came the era of Arduino. I loved building robots and then making them avoid obstacles. I still like the nature of connecting cables and resistors to make LEDs light up, but I have moved on to create more apps.

Of course, if we are talking about apps for PC you have to pick your poison: native or web. And honestly speaking, I don't like either of these options. The Web gives you fast distribution, but coding JavaScript is a pain, at least for me.

So I chose Python. If you use type hints, it will give you a lot of the benefits you would gain from a statically typed language while still being faster to iterate through ideas with. Using pyinstaller will also allow you to create native executables.

Since I started high school, I've been learning C++ in school, but I still don't consider it to be my strong side.

## What's next

I would definitely like to try Rust and see if it really lives up to the hype. A thing I have been putting off for quite a bit is to familiarize myself a bit more with networking, since knowing how to port forward a Minecraft server is not enough for me ;).
