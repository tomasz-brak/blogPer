## Hi

My name is Tomasz. I've interested in computers for as long as I can remember. When I finished my fifth grade in primary school I went and to an event, and written code for robots made of Lego, I feel in love with programming ever since.

## My journey

When I first started programming, I used simple tools. First was the visual editor for Lego. And then I familiarized myself with scratch. I've created way too many 2d games with that one. Then came the era of Arduino. I loved building robots and then making them avoid obstacles. Whitest I still like the nature of connecting cables and resistors to make LEDs light up, I have moved on to create more apps.

Of course if we are talking about apps for PC you have to pick your poison: native or web. And honestly speaking, I don't like either of these options. Web gives you the fast distribution, but coding JavaScript is a pain, at least for me.

So I chose python. If you use it correctly, it will give you a lot of benefits you would gain from a statically typed language, while still being faster to iterate through ideas with.

Someone might say that `there is no easy way to do guis` but I find it not true. The beauty of python is that you can connect it with so many other tools. You need web you use django or flask, you need native GUI PyQt and qtDesigner are awesome tools and you can make amazing things with them.

Now since I started high school I'm c++ in school, but I still don't consider it to be my strong side.

## What's next

I definitely would like to try rust and check does it really live up to the hype. And a thing I have been puting off for quite a bit is to familiarise myself a bit more with networking since knowing how to port forward a minecraft server is not enough for me ;).
